Description: Information about patient visits

**Purpose**:                         Link covid positive patients to all visits (not used for this analysis) and hospitalizations (used for this analysis) using current definition for 
                                     covid-related hospitalizations (i.e. positive test 16 days before through 1 day after hospital admission date). Produce a dummy that identifies that 
                                     hospitalization is covid-related (covid-associated-hosp).

**Source**:                          Copied over from Elliottâ€™s work with very little editing, all programs are run so data is saved locally to AlyssaPlatt (this protects original 
                                     content while giving access to previous work)

**Main analytic dataset produced**:  COHORT_HOSPITALIZATIONS
