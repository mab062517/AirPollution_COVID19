# 6_Pollutants
## Project: N3C Case-Crossover Study
## Analyst: Alyssa Platt (alyssa.platt@duke.edu)

**Purpose**:  Link monitor distances to pollutant datasets, aggregate to 20km metric, and embed 21 days of lags for each observation (for later use)


**Source**:   This workbook is mostly coded by Alyssa but imports semi-aggregated pollution dataset from Elliott’s folder (note: code workbooks for pollutants 
              would not copy over so pollution datasets are pulled directly from Elliott’s folder instead), with: 
                  
                  - Source dataset pm25_aggregations pulled from code workbook/folder: 3a. Air Quality – PM2.5
                  
                  
                  - Source dataset no2_aggregations pulled from code workbook/folder 3a. Air Quality – NO2
                 
                  
                  - Source dataset ozone_aggregations pulled from code workbook/folder 3a. Air Quality - Ozone


**Main analytic datasets produced**: pm25_distance_agg_wlag (PM2.5), no2_distance_agg_wlag (N02), ozone_distance_agg_wlag (ozone)
