Identifying patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by various algorithms

**Purpose**:                          Pull covid+ patients based on our agreed upon definition of covid positivity. Note that for this analysis we only use those who test positive via a covid 
                                      PCR test but the workbook includes information that would identify “presumptive” covid positives as well (via “condition_occurance” table)

**Source**:                           Copied over from Elliott’s work with very little editing, all programs are run so data is saved locally to AlyssaPlatt (this protects original content 
                                      while giving access to previous work)

**Main analytic dataset produced**:   ALL_COVID_POS_PATIENTS
