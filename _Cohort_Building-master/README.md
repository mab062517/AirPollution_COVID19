## Project: N3C Case-Crossover Study
## Analyst: Alyssa Platt (alyssa.platt@duke.edu)

**Purpose**:                         Combine all ingredients needed to make the final analytic dataset from all sources including both time invariant characteristics (e.g. via COVID_POS_PERSON_FACT) 
                                     and time-varying characteristics (pollution, climate, insurance information associated with hospitalization. Note that none that the eligibility criteria for the 
                                     case-crossover analysis are actually implemented in this code workbook (other than the patient population being from the “ever covid positive” pool). When new 
                                     variables are added to the analysis, they are mostly added in via this code workbook.his workbook does most of the processing and merging of data in preparation for 
                                     analysis, however, the code is left flexible so that resulting data can potentially be used for multiple projects

**Source**:                          Entirely coded by Alyssa with mix of LDS and source datasets from N3C as well as datasets produced from previous code workbooks

**Main analytic dataset produced**:  ch_final
